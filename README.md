# Finding Intersection Of Two Arrays
This program is designed to find and print common elements of two given arrays

Let constant DIM = (1e5+1) be maximum allowed size of the arrays.
You can change it according to your need, but it must not exceed maximum allowed array size in C language.

To run code, paste it into any IDE and just click RUN.

After code started running, it will ask you to enter data:
first line must contain natural number N < DIM
second line must contain N integers (it will be array A, every A[i] must fit into int type in C language)
third line must contain natural number M < DIM
second line must contain M integers (it will be array B, every B[i] must fit into int type in C language)

code will answer with two lines:
first line will contain number of common elements of arrays A and B
second line will contain these numbers in non-decreasing order
