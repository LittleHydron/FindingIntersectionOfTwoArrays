# Finding Intersection Of Two Arrays
This program is designed to find and print common elements of two given arrays

To run code, paste it into any IDE and just click RUN.

After code started running, it will ask you to enter data:
first line must contain natural number N <= 100000 (1e5)
second line must contain N integers (it will be array A)
third line must contain natural number M <= 100000 (1e5)
second line must contain M integers (it will be array B)

code will answer with two lines:
first line will contain number of common elements of arrays A and B
second line will contain these numbers in non-decreasing order
